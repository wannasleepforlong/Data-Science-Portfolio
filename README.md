## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- [Basic Speech Recognizer and Sentiment Analyser](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Basic-Speech-Recognizer-and-Sentiment-Analyser)
  - Implemented a speech recognizer and sentiment classifier on the converted text using nltk.
    
- [Spam Mail Predicion](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/ML-Practise-Projects/blob/main/Spam%20mail%20prediction%5BLoR%5D.ipynb)
  - Implemented a basic spam mail prediction using Logistic Regression.


## Image Processing

- Google Vision API Wrapper
  - Developed a wrapper for Google Cloud's Vision API to filter inappropriate user submitted images, memes and determine percentage of image used by text. Written using flask and Pillow, deployed to AWS lambda using zappa.


## Audio Processing

- [Speech MNIST Classification](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Speech-MNIST-Classification-2nd-Sem)
  - Classifying digits from 0 to 9 using audio data.


## Computer Vision
- [Deployed Face Detection Attendance System](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Deployed-Face-Detection-Attendance-System)
  - Face attendance system with the functions of taking, reading and compiling attendance deployed using streamlit.


## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

- [Lego Image Generator GAN](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Lego-Image-Generator-GAN-2nd-Sem)
  - Generation of middish LEGO images using DCGAN.

- [MNIST Image Generation and Noise Reduction Autoencoder](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/MNIST-Image-Generation-and-Noise-Reduction-Autoencoder-2nd-Sem)
  - Generating MNIST images and cleaning noise from the images using Autoencoder and Convolutional Autoencoder.

- [Cat Image Generator LSGAN](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Cat-Image-Generator-LSGAN)
  - A cat image generator made with the help of official pytorch documentation.

- [Celeba Face Generator DCGAN](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Celeba-Face-Generator-DCGAN)
  - Generation of face images using DCGAN without feature-selection.


## Data Munging (Cleaning)

While most, if not all, of these projects have a data munging aspect, the following were specifically exclusively data munging efforts.
