# Data Science Portfolio - Abhinav Painuli

Hey! I am Abhinav Painuli and this portfolio represents all my work and accomplisments in Data Science.


## Kaggle Competitions


## Visualizations


## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- [Basic Speech Recognizer and Sentiment Analyser](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Basic-Speech-Recognizer-and-Sentiment-Analyser)
  - Implemented a speech recognizer and sentiment classifier on the converted text using nltk.
    
- [Spam Mail Predicion](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/ML-Practise-Projects/blob/main/Spam%20mail%20prediction%5BLoR%5D.ipynb)
  - Implemented a basic spam mail prediction using Logistic Regression.


## Image Processing

- [CIFAR-10 RNN](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/ML-Practise-Projects/blob/main/CIFAR-10%5BRNN%5D.ipynb)
  - Classfication of cifar-10 dataset using RNN.


## Audio Processing

- [Speech MNIST Classification](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Speech-MNIST-Classification-2nd-Sem)
  - Classifying digits from 0 to 9 using audio data.


## Computer Vision

- [Deployed Face Detection Attendance System](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Deployed-Face-Detection-Attendance-System)
  - Face attendance system with the functions of taking, reading and compiling attendance deployed using streamlit.


## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

All of these projects required image processing as well, 

- [Lego Image Generator GAN](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Lego-Image-Generator-GAN-2nd-Sem)
  - Generation of middish LEGO images using DCGAN.

- [MNIST Image Generation and Noise Reduction Autoencoder](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/MNIST-Image-Generation-and-Noise-Reduction-Autoencoder-2nd-Sem)
  - Generating MNIST images and cleaning noise from the images using Autoencoder and Convolutional Autoencoder.

- [Cat Image Generator LSGAN](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Cat-Image-Generator-LSGAN)
  - A cat image generator made with the help of official pytorch documentation.

- [Celeba Face Generator DCGAN](https://github.com/wannasleepforlong/Celeba-Face-Generator-DCGAN)
  - Generation of face images using DCGAN without feature-selection.


## Data Munging

Even though most of these projects have some sort of data munging, following were specifically data munging projects.
